1. I confirm that I completed all the exercises in the lab
2. I ran into a lot of issues with MPI. I wasn't able to run it at first, and kept trying different things until I got it to run once and verified it worked, but it gave me an error "Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified". After a while, it stopped running altogether. I will do more troubleshooting, but I veriried it worked and completed the exercise so I called it good for now.
3. All these tools do the same thing in different ways. The one to me that seems the most purpose built for it was Chapel, and it reminds me of my use of OpenGL in the past. One other tool that I used before was CUDA, and that was pretty different than all of these. The one thing about Chapel that will take some getting used to is going to be the syntax, as the rest are mostly c/cpp syntax since they're just libraries, but Chapel is very different.
