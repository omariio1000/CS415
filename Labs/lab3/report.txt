This week's lab was pretty cool. OpenMP is very different than our focus from last lab, which was pthread. To be honest, I don't think I'm a fan of the approach of having directives control things, but I see the possible benefit of being able to transition more easily from sequential code. I've previously worked with CUDA, and they have a similar way of using compiler directives to unroll for loops, as an example. Learning more of how to use these different tools has been really interesting to me, as they are all pretty different from each other.
