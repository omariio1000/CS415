This lab was a good experience in learning different ways to stall threads to wait until a certain operation has occurred or blocking them until some condition changes. It was a good practical example of how doing this incorrectly can lead to results that are not accurate or that are unwanted, or that could cause errors, such as the buffer overflow in the producer-consumer application. The exercises complimented on each other nicely, with each successive one building off the one previous. The final exercise especially, I was able to use parts of the first exercise practically to fix an issue.
