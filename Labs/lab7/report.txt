This lab was a great introduction to MPI and message-passing. Overall, it was a really good learning opportunity, and the last one was a bit of a challenge! I figured it out though, and enjoyed solving the problems I was facing. I had to reference the slides a few times to remember how things worked, but it was a lot easier than learning how to use Chapel like last lab, since most of the syntax was very familiar. One thing that's annoying is that I can't seem to find the mpi.h file, so VSCode isn't able to use its intellisense properly, but this is not a big deal at all. Overall, I really enjoyed this lab.
