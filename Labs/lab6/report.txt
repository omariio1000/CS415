This lab was my first experience actually writing and running any fortran or chapel code. It was pretty interesting, and there was a decent learning curve. I had to keep referencing the slides to check for syntax, and had to check online at times as well. It was really fun to be honest, as I haven't used a new programming language in a while. The last one I used was CUDA, and that is already very similar to C++, so this was a really cool experience. Looking forward to using chapel more for the next assignment!
