This lab was pretty cool because I got to see the caveats of turning a sequential program into a parallel one, and how it affected execution time based on how many threadsare used. Unfortunately, I was unable to see any speedup in the parallel versions or performance improvements. The issue I believe comes from the overhead spawning extra threads and joining them as well as the printing in the c++ version. The C++ version was better than the open MP version, but was still faster on a single thread than on multiple. Overall, this was an interesting exercise, and I wonder if there are other tools that would improve the parallel performance of this program.
